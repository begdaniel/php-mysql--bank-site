# php-mysql--bank-site

This a learning project that I uploaded with the sole reason of showcasing the PHP skills I acquired so far.
It's based on Lynda.com's "PHP with MySQL Essential Training", parts 1 and 2.

The project is a site for a bank, with a publicly accessable page to show various content about the bank: History, Mission, etc.
More important is the private part, which is a collection of pages that allow admins to create profiles, log in with passwords, and also create, edit the content to be shown on the public site. These data are stored in a MySQL database.

The skills / topics I became familiar with through this project include:

- planning a website project
- HTML and PHP: headers, "include" and "require"
- form submissions, GET and POST requests, redirects
- CRUD in MySQL
- data validation in PHP
- working with sessions
- preventing XSS and SQL injection
